Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass Project is a system designed to help students book driving lessons and track their progress. It includes different users such as students, instructors,
administrators, and clients. Students can create accounts, log in, view available lessons, track their progress, and book or cancel reservations. Instructors can manage 
their schedules and add lesson notes. Administrators have higher access, allowing them to manage accounts, reset passwords, and oversee system security. 
The system ensures secure data handling with account permissions and protection features. The main challenges in designing the system were organizing the UML diagram
properly and ensuring all key functions were included.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did particularly well in identifying both the functional and nonfunctional requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose the UML diagrams, as I feel they need more work and detail. I will definitely study them further to improve my understanding.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
implemented the user’s needs in the diagrams, ensuring that the system design clearly reflects their requirements. Considering user needs is 
important because it provides developers with a clear roadmap, eliminating guesswork about what the client wants and ensuring the final product meets expectations.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design by breaking down problems into smaller sections and tackling the most challenging parts first. 
This helps make complex systems more manageable. In the future, I would use techniques like UML diagrams, user flow mapping, 
and modular design to better analyze and structure a system before development.
